Subject: Midterm Extension Request
Body:
Dear Professor,
I was all set to finish the assignment until my computer decided that now was the perfect time to update, crash, and spiritually leave its body.
Could I please get a one-day extension? I promise to only partially cry this time.
Sincerely,
Your favorite procrastinator
